> Can you show me some Cython code?

---

Sure! Here's an example of how to write and use a simple Cython extension:

python

```python
# mymath.pyx
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

python

```python
# setup.py
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules = cythonize("mymath.pyx")
)
```

Once you have the above files, run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to generate the extension module. This will create a `mymath.so` file (on Unix-like systems) or `mymath.pyd` file (on Windows) in the same directory as the `mymath.pyx` file.

You can then use the extension in your Python code like this:

python

```python
import mymath

print(mymath.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```

The Cython code above is a simple function that adds two numbers together. In this example, the function is very simple and doesn't require Cython to be faster than regular Python code. However, when working with more complex code that requires many loops or low-level manipulations, Cython can be a great tool to improve performance.

> How can I use Asyncio?

---

To use asyncio, you can follow these general steps:

1.  Define one or more coroutine functions that will run asynchronously. A coroutine is a special type of function that is defined using the `async def` syntax, and which returns an awaitable object.

python

```python
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    print('Starting coroutine')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('Coroutine completed')
```

2.  Create an event loop. An event loop is a central control structure that manages the execution of coroutines. You can use the `asyncio.get_event_loop()` function to get a reference to the default event loop, or create your own loop using the `asyncio.new_event_loop()` function.

python

```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
```

3.  Schedule your coroutine to run on the event loop using the `loop.create_task()` function. This creates a task object that wraps your coroutine and adds it to the event loop's task queue.

python

```python
task = loop.create_task(my_coroutine())
```

4.  Run the event loop using the `loop.run_until_complete()` function. This method blocks the current thread and runs the event loop until the coroutine is complete. If the coroutine is not complete, it will continue to run until it completes.

python

```python
loop.run_until_complete(task)
```

Here's an example that puts these steps together:

python

```python
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    print('Starting coroutine')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('Coroutine completed')

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
task = loop.create_task(my_coroutine())
loop.run_until_complete(task)
```

When you run this code, you should see "Starting coroutine" printed, followed by a 1-second delay, and then "Coroutine completed" printed.

Note that asyncio can be used to run multiple coroutines in parallel. To do this, you can create multiple tasks and add them to the event loop's task queue, and the event loop will execute them concurrently as resources allow.

> What is Monkey patching in Python?

---

Monkey patching is a technique in Python where you can modify the behavior of a module or a class at runtime by changing its attributes or methods.

In Python, everything is an object, including modules and classes. This means that you can modify their attributes and methods just like you would with any other object. Monkey patching involves changing the attributes or methods of a module or a class to alter their behavior, without modifying the original source code.

Here's an example of monkey patching a class in Python:

python

```python
# Define a class with a method
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Hello, world!")

# Create an instance of the class
obj = MyClass()

# Define a new method
def new_method(self):
    print("Monkey patching!")

# Replace the class's method with the new method
MyClass.my_method = new_method

# Call the method on the instance
obj.my_method()  # Output: "Monkey patching!"
```

In the above code, we define a class `MyClass` with a method `my_method`. We then create an instance of the class, and define a new method `new_method` that we want to use instead of the original method. Finally, we replace the class's method with the new method, and call it on the instance. When we call the method, we see the output "Monkey patching!" instead of "Hello, world!".

Monkey patching can be useful in certain situations where you need to modify the behavior of a class or module without changing its source code. However, it can also lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain, so it should be used judiciously.

> give me 10 advanced python tricks?

---

Sure, here are 10 advanced Python tricks that you can use to write more efficient and expressive code:

1.  List comprehension with conditionals: You can use list comprehensions to create new lists based on existing ones, and add conditionals to filter the elements you want to include. For example, the following code creates a list of even numbers from 0 to 10:

python

```python
even_numbers = [x for x in range(11) if x % 2 == 0]
```

2.  Context managers with the "with" statement: You can use the "with" statement to create a context manager, which provides a block of code with some setup and teardown actions that are automatically performed. For example, the following code creates a file and automatically closes it when the "with" block is finished:

python

```python
with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')
```

3.  Generator expressions: You can use generator expressions to create iterators that generate values on the fly, instead of creating a full list in memory. For example, the following code generates the first 10 even numbers:

python

```python
even_numbers = (x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0)
for number in even_numbers:
    print(number)
```

4.  Zip and unpacking: You can use the zip function to combine two or more lists into a list of tuples, and use unpacking to extract the elements of the tuples. For example, the following code zips two lists and unpacks the tuples:

python

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f'{name} is {age} years old')
```

5.  Extended iterable unpacking: You can use extended iterable unpacking to assign the first few elements of a list or tuple to separate variables, and the remaining elements to a new list or tuple. For example, the following code uses extended iterable unpacking to assign the first two elements to separate variables, and the remaining elements to a list:

python

```python
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a, b, *rest = mylist
print(a)    # Output: 1
print(b)    # Output: 2
print(rest) # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

6.  Dict comprehension: You can use dict comprehensions to create new dictionaries based on existing ones. For example, the following code creates a new dictionary that maps numbers to their squares:

python

```python
squares = {x: x*x for x in range(10)}
```

7.  Multiple function returns: You can use multiple returns to return more than one value from a function. For example, the following code defines a function that returns the quotient and remainder of two numbers:

python

```python
def divide(a, b):
    quotient = a // b
    remainder = a % b
    return quotient, remainder

q, r = divide(23, 5)
print(q) # Output: 4
print(r) # Output: 3
```

8.  Decorators: You can use decorators to modify the behavior of functions and classes. For example, the following code defines a decorator that logs the time it takes to execute a function:

python

```python
import time

def timeit(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f'{func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds')
        return result
```
