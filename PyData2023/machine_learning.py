"""Linear Regression -> foundational algorithms

Deep learning is inside Machine Learning:
Deep learning -> multiple blocks, several algorithms put together

Common uses of Machine Learning:

- Computer Vision

- Recommendation Engines (Netflix)
- Natural language Processing
- Time Series (stock predictions, sales, etc)
- Anomaly detections (e.g., someone steals your credit card)

It's all about understanding patterns



Deep learning is about complet input (photos, audio, videos, and so on)
