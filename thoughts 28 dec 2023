I am thinking about how to act in respect to my learning and practice processes regarding Codewars and just programming chellenges and exercises in general.

I think it would be a great idea to just save the ones that I can't currently resolve in a Notion page where I can find them again in the future and give them another go.

And, in the mean time I can take a good look at the solutions and understand as much as possible.
