# How to Use Let and Make

# Let

Subject + let + object + bare infinitive (infinitive without 'to')

'Let' can mean 'allow' or 'give permission':

    David's mother let him use her car.
    Our boss let us leave early.

---

We can also use 'let' to mean 'allow' in the sense of 'make something possible':

    This student card lets you book discount flights.
    You can buy a pass which lets you visit all the art galleries more cheaply.

Let's + infinitive is often used to make a suggestion:

    Let's go to the cinema tonight.
    Let's get some coffee.

---

# Make

Subject + make + object + bare infinitive (infinitive without 'to')

'Make' can mean 'force someone to do something that he or she doesn't want to do':

    His mother made him clean his room.
    The teacher made us study very hard.

---

It can also be used to mean 'cause someone to do something' (the thing can be good or bad):

    That film made me cry.
    My brother often makes me laugh.

---

If we use 'make' in the passive, we use the infinitive with 'to' instead of the bare infinitive:

    She was made to work on Saturday, even though she hated working at weekends.

---

We can also use subject + make + object + adjective. This means 'cause the object to be the adjective' (the adjective can be good or bad):

    Her story made me really happy.
    The traffic jam made us late.
