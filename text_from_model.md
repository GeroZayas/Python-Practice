The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh Scattering**.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, when it reaches Earth, appears white, but it's actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet – ROYGBIV). Each of these colors has a different wavelength, with red having the longest wavelength and violet having the shortest.

2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is composed of tiny gas molecules, mainly nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.

3.  **Scattering:** When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these tiny gas molecules. This causes the light to scatter in all directions. The key is that the **amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of the light.**

4.  **Blue Light Scatters More:** Rayleigh scattering states that shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered much more efficiently by tiny particles than longer wavelengths (like red and yellow).
    *   Blue light is scattered about 10 times more effectively than red light.

5.  **Why Blue (and not Violet)?**
    *   While violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue and scatters slightly more, there are a few reasons we perceive the sky as blue:
        *   **Our eyes' sensitivity:** Human eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light.
        *   **Sun's spectrum:** The sun doesn't emit as much violet light as it does blue light.
        *   **Further scattering:** Some of the violet light is scattered even higher in the atmosphere, and some of it is absorbed.
    *   So, a combination of scattered blue and violet light, weighted by our eyes' sensitivity, results in us seeing a predominantly blue sky.

**In summary:** As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the tiny air molecules scatter the shorter-wavelength blue and violet light more effectively in all directions. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky, making it appear blue. The longer-wavelength colors (red, orange, yellow) pass through the atmosphere more directly, which is why we see the sun itself as yellowish-white.

**What about sunsets and sunrises?**
At sunrise or sunset, the sun's light has to travel through much more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. This means even more of the blue and green light gets scattered away, leaving mostly the longer-wavelength red, orange, and yellow light to pass directly through, creating those beautiful red and orange hues in the sky.
